# GlassBed-GCode-Mod
A Python app that modifies a GCode file and inserts code to configure the following settings for the first 3 layers, individually: Print Speed, Nozzle Temp, Bed Temp. This is done in an attempt to make printing on Glass Beds less annoying in terms of initial adhesion. This script assumes that you are using files created by Cura and an Ender V3 SE.
